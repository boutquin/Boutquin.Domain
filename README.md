*** Very much a work in progress ***

This will contain all entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer.

A key extension class here is the [DecimalArrayExtensions class](https://github.com/boutquin/Boutquin.Domain/blob/master/Domain/doc/DecimalArrayExtensions.md), a static class that provides extension methods for working with arrays of decimal values. It includes methods for calculating the variance and standard deviation of an array of decimal values.
